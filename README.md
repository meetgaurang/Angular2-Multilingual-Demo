# Angular (2 & above) Multilingual Demo with ngx-translate

A simple multilingual Angular application. It supports four languages; English, Gujarati, Hindi and French. [ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate) - an Angular library was used to achieve this multilingual behavior. All language mapping resource files (e.g. en.json, gu.json, hi.json & fr.json) are kept under src/assets/i18n.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
